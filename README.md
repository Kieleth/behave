The purpose of Behave is to help people control themselves in front of a computer.

Future versions aim to allow the user to teach the application how to recongnice unwanted actions, like nail bitting for example.

Behave uses the webcam of the computer and processes the video stream to capture what is told to do.

Uses OpenCV and Python.
